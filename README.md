## üåü Features

### Visual Effects
- **Dynamic Particle System**: Hundreds of animated particles with fluid motion
- **Real-time Connections**: Particles connect when within range, creating a network effect
- **Mouse Interaction**: Particles are attracted to your cursor with adjustable gravity
- **Particle Trails**: Smooth trails follow each particle's movement
- **Glow Effects**: Energy-based glow system for enhanced visuals
- **Click Explosions**: Click anywhere to create particle explosions

### UI Controls
- **Particle Density** (100-2000): Control the number of particles
- **Flow Velocity** (0.1-5): Adjust particle movement speed
- **Connection Range** (50-200): Set the maximum distance for particle connections
- **Gravity Force** (0-2): Control cursor attraction strength
- **Energy Field** (0-100): Adjust the particle field effects

### Themes
- **Default**: Green primary with pink secondary colors
- **Neon**: Vibrant magenta and cyan
- **Ocean**: Cool blues and aqua tones
- **Sunset**: Warm oranges and reds

### Presets
- **Calm**: Gentle, slow-moving particles for a relaxing experience
- **Dynamic**: Balanced settings for active visualization
- **Chaos**: High-energy, fast-moving particle storm
- **Minimal**: Fewer particles with subtle movements

### Additional Features
- **Wave Visualizer**: Bottom panel shows audio-like wave animations
- **Statistics Panel**: Real-time FPS, particle count, connections, and energy monitoring
- **Minimizable Panels**: Click minimize buttons to hide/show control panels
- **Persistent Settings**: Panel states are saved in localStorage
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
  - `Space`: Pause/Resume animation
  - `R`: Reset particles
  - `C`: Clear all particles

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

4. Switch themes using the theme buttons
5. Try different presets for varied experiences
6. Minimize panels by clicking the arrow button

## üéÆ Controls Guide

### Sliders
- **Particle Density**: More particles = more connections but higher performance impact
- **Flow Velocity**: Higher values create faster, more chaotic movement
- **Connection Range**: Larger ranges create more interconnected networks
- **Gravity Force**: Stronger gravity makes particles follow your cursor more closely
- **Energy Field**: Adds wave-like motion to particle movement

### Performance
The visualization automatically detects your device capabilities and adjusts:
- **High Performance**: Full effects with trails and glow
- **Medium Performance**: Balanced effects
- **Low Performance**: Reduced effects for smooth animation

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Technologies Used
- **HTML5 Canvas**: Hardware-accelerated 2D rendering
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No frameworks, pure performance
- **CSS3**: Glassmorphism UI with backdrop filters
- **ES6+**: Modern JavaScript features

### Performance Optimizations
- Spatial grid system for efficient connection calculations
- Object pooling for explosion particles
- Dynamic quality adjustment based on FPS
- RequestAnimationFrame for smooth 60fps animation
- Efficient particle culling and boundary wrapping
